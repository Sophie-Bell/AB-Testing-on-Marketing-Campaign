# A/B Testing for a Marketing Campaign :dollar:
## Objective:
The primary objective of conducting an A/B test on a marketing campaign is to scientifically **evaluate and compare the performance of the control and test group to determine which one yields the most favorable and statistically significant results.**

## Project Description :open_file_folder:
In this project, I will do the following:
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents
- Clean the data, handle missing values
- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses for the test
- Ensure that the assignment of subjects to control (A) and treatment (B) groups is randomized and unbiased
- Determine the key metrics and performance indicators that will be used to evaluate the impact of the changes
- Perform the A/B test by comparing the performance of the control group (A) and treatment group (B) with respect to the chosen metrics
- Calculate relevant statistics, including p-values and confidence intervals, to assess the statistical significance of the results
- Visualize and interpret any trends or differences between the A and B groups.

## Data Source :bar_chart:
The **raw dataset** comes from the [A/B Data Testing Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/ab-testing-dataset/data). 

This data frame contains 9 variables that correspond to:

**Campaign Name:** The name of the campaign

**Date:** Date of the record

**Spend:** Amount spent on the campaign in dollars per day

**Num of Impressions:** Number of impressions the ad crossed through the campaign

**Reach:** The number of unique impressions received in the ad

**Num of Website Clicks:** Number of website clicks received through the ads

**Num of Searches:** Number of users who performed searches on the website

**Num of View Content:** Number of users who viewed content and products on the website

**Num of Add to Cart:** Number of users who added products to the cart

**Num of Purchase:** Number of purchases
<br><br>

In addition, there were two campaigns were performed by the company:

**Control Campaign**

**Test Campaign**

## Results :star:
The examination of KPI distribution over time showcased distinct trends, with the test campaign strategically managing a decrease in CPC and CPA, leading to potential improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the test campaign consistently outperformed the control in CTR, showcasing more effective audience engagement. Furthermore, the parallel improvement in Conversion Rate for both campaigns signifies a shared commitment to enhanced user engagement.

Hypothesis testing results provided statistical validation of our findings, indicating significant differences in CTR, suggesting the test campaign's superiority in attracting clicks. While other metrics did not exhibit statistically significant differences, the trends observed throughout the study empower organizations to make informed decisions regarding marketing budget allocation, content optimization, and audience targeting.
